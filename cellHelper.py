    the relationship between the radius of a cross-sectional circle along the ellipsoid and the displacement
    along the major axis of the ellipsoid is given by (x^2) / ((l / 2)^2) + r^2 / R^2 = 1
    where x is the displacement along the axis, r is the radius of the cross-sectional circle, l / 2 is the major axis, and R
    is the radius of the larges cross-sectional circle. Further, x and r are related by tan(theta) = r / x, where theta is, of course,
    the attatchment angle. Combining these two relations yields a solution for axial and radial displacements that satisfyt the attatchment angle.

    The next step is to vectorize these displacements. The axial displacement is along the direction of the parent cell's axis.
    The radial displacement should be a randomly chosen direction perpendicular to the parent's axis. Taking the cross product of the
    parent cell's axis vector with any random vector will yield a result in the plane perpendicular to the axis. So simply generate a vector
    with 3 random components, cross it with the parent's axis, and the resulting vector will be the desired random radial direction'''
